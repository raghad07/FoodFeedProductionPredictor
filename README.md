# Forecasting Model for World Food Production

This project demonstrates a forecasting model built using TensorFlow for predicting future food production based on the World FoodFeed dataset. The goal of the model is to provide insights and predictions for food production trends, aiding in planning and decision-making in the agricultural sector.

The code includes the following key steps:

# Data Preparation: 
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and loaded into the code using pandas. Preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

# Data Pipeline:
 A data pipeline is created using TensorFlow's Dataset API to handle data shuffling, batching, and prefetching, ensuring efficient training.

# Model Architecture: 
The forecasting model is built using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, and dense layers. The model is designed to capture temporal dependencies and make accurate predictions.

# Model Training:
 The model is compiled with appropriate loss and optimization functions, and then trained using the training dataset. The validation dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance during training.

# Model Evaluation:
 Various performance metrics are computed to assess the model's accuracy and generalization ability. These metrics help understand the model's effectiveness in predicting future food production.

# Model Deployment:
 Gradio is used to create a user-friendly interface for making predictions based on user input.
